# üìÑ DocWise: Intelligent Document Q&A Assistant

**DocWise** is a smart, RAG-based assistant that lets users interact with complex PDF documents through natural language. It combines document parsing, vector-based retrieval, and LLM-powered generation to answer queries, summarize content, and display relevant visual elements like figures and diagrams.

## Features

- üß† **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)**: Combines vector similarity search with LLMs for accurate, grounded answers.
- üóÉÔ∏è **PDF Parsing**: Extracts structured text, images, tables, and metadata from uploaded documents.
- üí¨ **Dual Mode Query Handling**: Determines if a question requires summarization or detailed retrieval.
- üñºÔ∏è **Visual Context**: Retrieves and validates figures/diagrams relevant to the user's question.
- ‚ö° **Fast and Modular**: Uses LangChain, OpenAI GPT-4o, and Qdrant for scalable performance.
- üåê **Streamlit Frontend**: Clean and interactive interface for document uploads and chatting.

```
### Running the App

After setting up the environment and installing dependencies, launch the app using:

```bash
streamlit run app.py
```


## Disclaimer

This project was built for **educational and experimental purposes**. While it demonstrates key concepts in retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), document processing, and AI-assisted querying, it is **not intended for production use**. Certain implementation choices were made for learning and rapid prototyping rather than strict adherence to modern industry standards.
